# ASP.NET-MVC-Pizzeria
A web solution for a Pizzeria, using ASP.NET Core MVC, Core Identity for user authentication/authorization and Entity Framework for handling the SQL-db. 

NOTE: Before using the application a database needs to be created, either via visual studio using a code-first approach or using the tomasos.bak file included in the project. I recommend using the included .bak file since it has recipes, ingredients, users, roles and most importantly an admin user created. Since passwords are encrypted use the password "Admin123" for the user named "Admin" to gain access to admin specific functions on the webpage (probably the most interesting part of this project). 

Also note some things have not been implemented and the styling is very simplified for it to be called "release worthy"! :)
